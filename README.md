This is the collection of exercises from the course Information theory for complex systems (FIM780) at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. The course is a part of the Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) program.

Course overview: The course provides an understanding of fundamental concepts used to describe complex systems, in particular dynamical systems such as chaotic low-dimensional systems, self-organizing systems, and simple spatially extended systems such as cellular automata. Many of the concepts are based in information theory.

Basic concepts of information theory: 

Shannon entropy, complexity measures.

Information theory and statistical mechanics.

Geometric information theory -- randomness and complexity in spatially extended systems.

Information flow. The relation between microscopic and macroscopic levels.

Statistical models, in particular hidden Markov models.

Cellular automata.

Applications in nonlinear dynamics, computational biology, chemical self-organizing systems, and statistical mechanics.
